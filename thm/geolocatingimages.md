### [Task 2] Getting our feet wet - where is this?

Try some reverse image searching with [Google](https://www.google.de/imghp) and [Yandex](https://yandex.com/images/search).

With Google you will find something, but it isn't helpful. For me a bunch of liquid balls showed up.

Yandex on the other hand finds the object perfectly. Just like the text from Task 1 told us. You will find the answer to the task on the caption of one of the search results.

**What can you see?**\
There are two street signs.
* North Sheffield Avenue
* West Addison Street
  
*How about hacking them into google?*

You will quickly find a place in Chicago, USA. Now use maps to locate the images subject and then turn around 180 degrees and find the answer.

To find the broader area direct your attention onto the two large landmarks in the background.
* a river and
* a tower of some sort

The tower looks a bit like the Eiffel tower in Paris and therefore the river may be the Seine.

Now open a map of your choice and try to locate the images view in *Meudon forest* south-west of Paris.\
On Gogle maps you will find, as a marked point of interest, the *Paris Observatory*.\
Find it on Wikipedia and find out which facility is shown in the current image, combine it with what you already know and you have the answer.

Remember the text from Task 5?\
Use your knowledge to find the following key points:
* main focus is a road
* left hand driving
* livestream of some sort

From the driving part try to think about a country for to match it. (e.g. Great Britain)\
Combine the bits of intel into a search term for Google and find the answer as one of the top results.
